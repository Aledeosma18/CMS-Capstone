### About: 
This project looks at mapping US census data to better understand the patterns and information that US Citizens provide in their census report. 


### Initial Vission: 

Our initial vision at the start of this semester was to use historical census data and apply an AI algorithm that we could use to predict future population/demographic shifts in five major cities that we picked. We were going to simply do population movement based on race, education and income. Our vision adapted over time due to various roadblocks that we faced this semester and the largest issue we had was finding data that had all the factors we need and that was consistent for the five major cities we were looking at while having that data span enough years for us to apply the AI algorithm to it. 

### Data:
